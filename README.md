# FDF_WeThinkCode
This is a simple 3D landscape renderer. In this project, we look at the basics of graphics programming, and in particular how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and how to observe the scene from a particular point of view.  As a way to start my journey into graphics programming, FDF requires us to draw the wireframe of a 3D landscape.  The project was made using my first graphics library: MinilibX. This library is developed internally by Ecole 42 and using it's basic features for this project, we learn how to open a graphic window and draw inside it.
