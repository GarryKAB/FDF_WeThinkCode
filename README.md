# FDF_WeThinkCode
This is a simple 3D landscape renderer. This is the most basic form of the project but there are extra features I have planned for it.
In this project, we look at the basics of graphics programming, and in particular how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and how to observe the scene from a particular point of view.

As a way to start my journey into graphics programming, FDF requires us to draw the wireframe of a 3D landscape.

The project was made using my first graphics library: MinilibX. This library is developed internally by Ecole 42 and using it's basic features for this project, we learn how to open a graphic window and draw inside it.

## Planned features
* 3D mouse rotations
* Camera controls (Zooming in & our, translate)
* Pretty colour gradients
* Different view modes
* Different depth projections

## Running and compiling
Run `make` and an executable will compile. This is currently only rested on OS X
Run the program with `./fdf [map]`. There are some maps provided in the maps directory.
The following maps are used in the screenshots above:
* `maps/42.fdf`
* `maps/elem.fdf`
* `maps/mars.fdf`
 
There are currently no controls available so the map will simply display.
The project runs properly but it has some minor issues that I will get to whenever I can.
